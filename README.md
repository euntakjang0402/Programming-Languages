# CS-210
CS-210: C++

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
There was a file of all the input/ items that were purchased, titled "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt". We had to make 4 different options for the user to capture the summary of that data. Option one was to see the frequency of 1 item. Option 2 was a list with the items and frequency. Option 3 was a historgram represented by "*". Option 4 was to exit the program.

#What did you do particularly well?
For the most part, everything was pretty smooth

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Enhancements could include adding error handling, optimizing search for item frequency, and modularizing the program.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
File input/output and menu options may be challenging. Tools/resources could include C++ documentation, online forums, and error handling libraries.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Transferable skills include knowledge of fundamental programming concepts and the importance of code organization and readability.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable due to the use of clear and descriptive variable names, comments, and logical program organization.
